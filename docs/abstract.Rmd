Originally developed for macro-ecology, beta-diversity metrics are commonly used to assess overall community similarity between microbiome samples.
The effects of sequencing depth and error rates on beta diversity calculations have not been thoroughly studied.
In the following study, we evaluate the impact of sequence characteristics on beta-diversity analyses, and how well they are handled by different bioinformatic pipelines and normalization methods.
We use a mixture dataset of stool samples from five vaccine trial participants, collected before and after exposure to a pathogen and mixed following a two-sample titration.
The sequencing data were processed using six bioinformatics pipelines, including sequence inference, _de novo_, and reference based clustering approaches, along with nine normalization methods, including standard rarefaction approaches and numeric normalization techniques.
We assess (1) beta-diversity repeatability for PCR replicates across multiple sequencing libraries and runs, (2) the ability to differentiate groups of samples with varying levels of similarity and (3) differences in beta-diversity between biological and technical factors.
The Mothur and DADA2 pipelines were more robust to sequencing errors compared to the other pipelines evaluated in the study.
Out of the normalization methods compared in the study we suggest using total sum scaling for weighted metrics.
Normalizing counts using rarefaction improved assessment results for unweighted metrics.
Furthermore, we found normalization methods developed for microarray and RNA sequencing data, including trimmed mean of M values (TMM) and relative log expression (RLE), may not be appropriate for marker-gene survey beta-diversity analysis.
