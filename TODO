## Primary Analysis
- data for pipe characterization   
    - sparsity calculation  
    - drop out rate calculation 

## Coding
- evaluate munge results for failed runs
- check for normalization and diversity estimate errors
- clean up make ps munge code formatting

## Seq and Pipe QA
- move PhiX to munge  
- move read_count to munge  
- pipe characterization info  
- species abundance curves   
- rarefaction curves  
- dada2 seq quality plots  

## bio v. tech 
- Statistical test, PERMANOVA??

## comparison to expectation
- rerun with pipeline results
- results analysis and presentation

## technical artifacts
- correlate B-div with difference in seq number and quality

## Issues 
- Error in DADA2 tree build - optim.ml matrix too large.... 
    - use NJ tree  
    - email phangorn developer about issue  
- NTC read counts NIST consistent with sample counts  
    - compare feature count information to see if consistent with read count info.
