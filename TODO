## Primary Analysis
- restructure code for faster load.project() and updating files 

## Coding  
- evaluate munge results for failed runs: normalization, diversity, and cluster eval
        - pluck results and get number of failures and error messages 
        - investigate error source  
- clean up make ps munge code formatting

## Seq and Pipe QA
- species abundance curves   
- rarefaction curves  

## Sample characterization  
- beta diversity - unmixed samples  

## bio v. tech 
- Statistical test, PERMANOVA??

## comparison to expectation
- results analysis and presentation

## technical artifacts
- figure out what quality score to use for analysis
- correlate B-div with difference in seq number and quality

## Issues and notes
- Error in DADA2 tree build - optim.ml matrix too large.... 
    - use NJ tree  
    - email phangorn developer about issue  
- Check out NTC 1-H12 has a high read count, pass_rate, and total abundance
