## Primary Analysis

## Coding  
- evaluate munge results for failed runs
- check for normalization and diversity estimate errors
- debug make_beta_df and beta eval
- clean up make ps munge code formatting

## Seq and Pipe QA
- species abundance curves   
- rarefaction curves  
- dada2 seq quality plots  

## Sample characterization  
- beta diversity - unmixed samples  

## bio v. tech 
- Statistical test, PERMANOVA??

## comparison to expectation
- results analysis and presentation

## technical artifacts
- figure out what quality score to use for analysis
- correlate B-div with difference in seq number and quality

## Issues 
- Error in DADA2 tree build - optim.ml matrix too large.... 
    - use NJ tree  
    - email phangorn developer about issue  
- Check out NTC 1-H12 has a high read count, pass_rate, and total abundance  
- Normalize phyloseq seq is slow due to loading all pipeline RDS...
