# To Dos
- check mixed-effect model fit 
- send to Justin and Arlin for review 
- fix pipeline names
- fix seq run / lab names

# Maybe To Dos
- Single read analysis 
- removing singletons  
- log2 transformed counts
- Deblur using qiime2
- revise experimental design figure
- trim figures
- supplemental
    - Trellis
        - tech artifacts on other sequencing runs and unweighted metrics (fig 4)
        - Bio v. Technical
        - Signal/noise - Nate
    - Technical artifacts norm method plot for other sequencing runs
    - Fig 4: weighted and unweighted metrics and figures for the other seq runs


## Coding and Reproducibility
- clean up make ps munge code formatting
- add data descriptions
- consistent variable names
- faster manuscript build
- long term: using drake for munging https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/06/drake/

## Backing up
using rsync to backup repo to remote repository
```
rsync -rv --progress --delete \
  Projects/Dissertation/diversity_assessment \
  nolson@cbcbsub00.umiacs.umd.edu:/fs/cbcb-scratch/nolson/
```

## Issues and notes
- Error in DADA2 tree build - optim.ml matrix too large....
    - use NJ tree
    - email phangorn developer about issue

- Check out NTC 1-H12 has a high read count, pass_rate, and total abundance

- Potential relevant reference on normalization and beta-diversity
