# Before sending to Hector
## Statistical Models
- technical artifacts - Nate

## Analysis
- batch effects - Jackie
- incorporate signal-to-noise - Nate

## Bio v. Tech - After meeting with Nate Swenson
- bio v. technical variation - Both think 
- varpart sanity check
- Varpart
    - debugging 09 munge: error with jaccard - line 86

## Manuscript
- revise methods - Nate
- revise discussion - Nate
  + For discussion — look up reareq15 stats - Jackie (phyloseq colSum)
- clean-up figures and tables
    Fig 1- resize to fit
    Table 1- add number of singletons - Jackie (phyloseq rowSum == 1)
    Fig 4- split into two (weighted and unweighted), add lines for raw interquartile range and median values, generate for other seq runs (JHU 1&2 and NIST2) to add to supplemental— are there any major differences (esp with rarefaction for poorer quality runs) - Jakie
- Review draft - Jackie Friday


# After sending to Hector 
- acknowledgements
- format for microbiome
- Figures 
    Fig 5- leave for now, but maybe make into ink boxplots like in fig 4    
- supplemental
    - Trellis
        - tech artifacts on other sequencing runs and unweighted metrics (fig 4)
        - Bio v. Technical 
        - Signal/noise - Nate
- Look into QIIME default parameters

## Coding and Reproducibility
- clean up make ps munge code formatting
- add data descriptions
- consistent variable names
- faster manuscript build
- long term: using drake for munging https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/06/drake/

## Backing up
using rsync to backup repo to remote repository
```
rsync -rv --progress --delete \
  Projects/diversity_assessment \
  nolson@cbcbsub00.umiacs.umd.edu:/fs/cbcb-scratch/nolson/
```

## Issues and notes
- Manuscript formatting
    - error when using hyperref and email references
    - lmodern package needed for font warning

- Error in DADA2 tree build - optim.ml matrix too large....
    - use NJ tree
    - email phangorn developer about issue

- Check out NTC 1-H12 has a high read count, pass_rate, and total abundance

- Potential relevant reference on normalization and beta-diversity
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/02/06/259325.full.pdf

- Warning messages from re-running normalization
