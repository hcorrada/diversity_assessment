## Primary Analysis
- create new dada2 phyloseq object - waiting on final tree
- rerun munging scripts
- save phyloseq objects to rds rather than RData in cache, only cache data needed for analysis - Need to run code to check
- code to generate data frame with diversity metric results
- data for seq characterization  
- data for pipe characterization  

## Coding
- evaluate munge results for failed runs
- check for normalization and diversity estimate errors

## Seq and Pipe QA
- move PhiX to munge  
- move read_count to munge  
- pipe characterization info  
- species abundance curves   
- rarefaction curves  
- dada2 seq quality plots  

## Beta diversity assessement
- bio v. tech 
    - Statistical test
- comparison to expectation
    - rerun with pipeline results
    - results analysis and presentation
- technical artifacts
