## Issues and notes  
- Manuscript formatting
    - error when using hyperref and email references  
    - lmodern package needed for font warning

- Error in DADA2 tree build - optim.ml matrix too large.... 
    - use NJ tree  
    - email phangorn developer about issue  

- Check out NTC 1-H12 has a high read count, pass_rate, and total abundance    

- Warning messages from re-running normalization
